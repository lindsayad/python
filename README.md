These are Python scripts that I've used/created. 1-sentence summary of each file:

1D\_temp_script: Convert Comsol temperature data into a standard 1-D plot, z vs. T

1D\_water\_vapor_script: Combine Comsol water vapor data from two different locations 
into 1-D plot, r vs. H2O

Dimple.py: From Comsol data creates 1D plot comparing NO uptake with and without dimple
deformation present, time vs. NO

Geometry.py: Script that reproduces the Comsol modelling geometry through simple drawing
of lines and generation of annotations

GeometryDeformed.py: Very similar to Geometry.py except at one point in the geometry,
a straight line is replaced with an elliptical arc

HNO3\_convection\_2D\_plot_script: Creates 2D surface color plot of HNO3 concentration
data when convection is present

HNO3\_diffusion\_2D\_plot_script: Identical script to HNO3\_convection... except it
loads a different input file

NO\_uptake\_script.py: Create standard 1-D plot from input text file

Nitrate\_uptake\_script.py: Same as NO\_uptake... but different input file is loaded

Temperature\_plot\_script: Creates 2D surface color plot of Temperature using data
from input text file

Water\_vapor\_plot\_script: Creates 2D surface color plot of water vapor concentration
using data from input text file

logOH.py: Script creates a 3D surface plot with coloring to emphasize changes in logOH
concentration versus r and z coordinates

logONOOH.py: Similar to logOH.py except it loads logONOOH concentration data instead
of logOH

logONOOH_produced.py: Similar to logOH.py 

velocity.py: Creates 2D surface color plot of velocity magnitude vs. r and z coordinates.
Script also shows how to add vector arrows indicating in this case the direction and
magnitude of the velocity field.
